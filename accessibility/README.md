# What is Web Accessibility

## Overview

Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can:

- perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
- contribute to the Web

Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including:

- auditory
- cognitive
- neurological
- physical
- speech
- visual

Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for example:

- people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.
- older people with changing abilities due to ageing
- people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or lost glasses
- people with “situational limitations” such as in bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot listen to audio
- people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth
